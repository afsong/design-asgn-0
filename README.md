## Design
In this assignment, I decided to use linked list because I don't need to resize it. 

There are three functions in the assignment: 

```
// add a person to the record with his unique identifying number
// No change if num is already present
add(Integer num)

// remove a person to the record with his unique identifying number
remove(Integer num)

//total number in quarantine
quarantineNum()
```
